# Complete MSL ${msl_version} Specification

## Summary

This specification provides the complete, authoritative definition of Markdown Specification Language (MSL) version ${msl_version}, specified entirely using MSL itself. It demonstrates MSL's capability for self-specification while serving as the definitive reference for MSL implementation and usage.

This specification integrates the layered architecture (L0, L1, L2) with domain-specific specifications (Grammar, Semantics, Processing) to provide comprehensive MSL coverage through inheritance and composition.

## Usage Examples

### Self-Specification Validation

```bash
# Validate complete MSL specification using MSL tools
msl-lint specs/msl-complete.md

# Validate complete inheritance chain  
msl-validate specs/msl-complete.md --check-inheritance

# Render complete specification with variables
msl-render specs/msl-complete.md -v msl_version=1.1
```

### MSL Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create new MSL feature specification
msl-render specs/templates/feature-spec.md -v feature_name=NewFeature

# 2. Validate against MSL standards
msl-lint specs/new-feature.md

# 3. Test inheritance from appropriate base
msl-validate specs/new-feature.md --check-parents

# 4. Generate documentation
msl-render specs/new-feature.md --format=html
```

## Achievement Summary

This specification represents the successful completion of MSL self-specification:

### ✅ Bootstrap Achieved
- MSL defined using MSL itself through layered architecture
- Each level builds upon previous using MSL's own features
- Complete specification created through inheritance composition

### ✅ Completeness Demonstrated  
- All MSL features exercised in self-specification
- Grammar, semantics, and processing fully defined
- Tool requirements specified for implementation

### ✅ Validation Enabled
- Self-specification can validate itself using MSL tools
- Circular self-reference successfully implemented
- MSL proved capable of specifying complex systems

### ✅ Dogfooding Established
- MSL development uses MSL for its own evolution
- MSL tools process MSL's own specifications
- MSL serves as its own comprehensive test case

## Notes

This complete MSL specification demonstrates that MSL has achieved true self-specification capability. The ability to define MSL entirely using MSL itself validates the language's completeness and expressive power.

The layered bootstrap approach (L0→L1→L2→Grammar→Semantics→Processing→Complete) provides a clear evolution path while maintaining backward compatibility and demonstrating all MSL features through practical usage.

MSL ${msl_version} is now fully self-specified and ready for use in specifying any system, domain, or requirement set with confidence in its foundational completeness.
