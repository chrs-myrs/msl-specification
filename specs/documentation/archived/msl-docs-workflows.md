# MSL Workflows Documentation Specification [MSL]

## Summary

This specification defines requirements for MSL workflow documentation covering individual, team, and AI-assisted specification development patterns and best practices.

## Requirements

### Workflow Categories

- REQ-001: [!] [NEW] Must document 3 workflows: solo, team, LLM-integration
- REQ-002: [!] [NEW] Each workflow must be complete guide (≤3000 words)
- REQ-003: [NEW] Workflows must include day-in-life scenarios
- REQ-004: [NEW] Must show progression from initial to mature usage
- REQ-005: [NEW] Must include decision points and branching paths

### Solo Workflow Documentation

- REQ-101: [!] [NEW] Must cover personal specification management lifecycle
- REQ-102: [NEW] Must include ≥5 productivity tips specific to individuals
- REQ-103: [NEW] Must show file organization for 1-10, 10-50, 50+ specs
- REQ-104: [NEW] Must include tooling setup for single developer
- REQ-105: [NEW] Must demonstrate refactoring and maintenance patterns

### Team Workflow Documentation

- REQ-201: [!] [NEW] Must cover team collaboration patterns
- REQ-202: [!] [NEW] Must include branching and merging strategies
- REQ-203: [NEW] Must define ≥3 team roles and responsibilities
- REQ-204: [NEW] Must show review and approval processes
- REQ-205: [NEW] Must include conflict resolution procedures
- REQ-206: [NEW] Must demonstrate CI/CD integration

### LLM Integration Workflow

- REQ-301: [!] [NEW] Must explain AI-assisted specification writing
- REQ-302: [!] [NEW] Must include ≥5 effective prompt templates
- REQ-303: [NEW] Must show validation of AI-generated specs
- REQ-304: [NEW] Must cover context management strategies
- REQ-305: [NEW] Must include quality control procedures
- REQ-306: [NEW] Must demonstrate Claude Code agent usage

### Workflow Patterns

- REQ-401: [!] [NEW] Each workflow must include ≥3 common patterns
- REQ-402: [NEW] Patterns must show: trigger, actions, outcomes
- REQ-403: [NEW] Must include anti-patterns to avoid
- REQ-404: [NEW] Must provide decision trees for pattern selection
- REQ-405: [NEW] Must include time estimates for each pattern

### Tool Integration

- REQ-501: [!] [NEW] Must show git workflow integration
- REQ-502: [NEW] Must include IDE/editor setup (≥3 editors)
- REQ-503: [NEW] Must demonstrate validation pipeline setup
- REQ-504: [NEW] Must show documentation generation workflow
- REQ-505: [NEW] Must include automation opportunities

### Migration and Adoption

- REQ-601: [!] [NEW] Must include adoption roadmap for each workflow
- REQ-602: [NEW] Must identify ≥5 common obstacles and solutions
- REQ-603: [NEW] Must provide transition timeline (weeks 1-4)
- REQ-604: [NEW] Must include success metrics and KPIs
- REQ-605: [NEW] Must show gradual complexity introduction

## Validation Criteria

Workflow documentation is valid when:
- Each workflow is complete and self-contained
- Patterns are practical and tested
- Tool integrations work as documented
- Adoption paths are realistic
- Examples represent real scenarios

## Notes

Workflow documentation bridges the gap between understanding MSL concepts and applying them effectively in real projects. Each workflow should be immediately actionable.
