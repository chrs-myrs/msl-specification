- REQ-103: [!] MUST cover validation and quality metrics
- REQ-104: MUST explain markers, templates, and other L2 features
- REQ-105: MUST introduce metaspecs and their governance role

### Best Practices and Patterns

- REQ-201: [!] MUST include DO and DON'T examples for key features
- REQ-202: MUST provide specification design patterns
- REQ-203: MUST explain MSL level selection criteria
- REQ-204: MUST include common issues and solutions

### Multiple Learning Paths

- REQ-301: [!] MUST support different user expertise levels
- REQ-302: MUST include practical examples from various domains

## Validation Criteria

User guide documentation is valid when:

- Best practices are clear and actionable
- Multiple learning paths are supported
- Content helps users accomplish real tasks

## Notes

The user guide provides comprehensive coverage of MSL for users who need more than a quick start. It inherits common documentation requirements from msl-docs-base and focuses on the unique aspects of comprehensive, task-oriented documentation.
