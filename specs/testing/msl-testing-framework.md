# MSL Testing Framework [MSL]

## Overview

This specification defines the testing framework and quality assurance approach for the MSL ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Core Testing Infrastructure

- REQ-TEST-001: Testing framework must use pytest as the test runner
- REQ-TEST-002: All tests must be discoverable via pytest's standard discovery mechanism
- REQ-TEST-003: Test files must follow the pattern `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
- REQ-TEST-004: Test functions must follow the pattern `test_*`
- REQ-TEST-005: Tests must be runnable individually or as a complete suite

### Test Organization

- REQ-TEST-010: Tests must be organized in a `tests/` directory at project root
- REQ-TEST-011: Unit tests must directly test individual functions/classes
- REQ-TEST-012: Integration tests must verify component interactions
- REQ-TEST-013: Each new feature must include corresponding tests
- REQ-TEST-014: Test files should mirror the structure of the code they test

### Regression Prevention

- REQ-TEST-020: Tests must run automatically via pre-commit hooks
- REQ-TEST-021: All tests must pass before allowing commits
- REQ-TEST-022: Failed tests must provide clear error messages
- REQ-TEST-023: Tests must catch breaking changes to existing functionality
- REQ-TEST-024: Test suite must complete within reasonable time (<30 seconds)

### Test Quality Standards

- REQ-TEST-030: Tests must be deterministic and reproducible
- REQ-TEST-031: Tests must not depend on external services or network
- REQ-TEST-032: Tests must clean up any temporary files or state
- REQ-TEST-033: Tests should use descriptive names explaining what they verify
- REQ-TEST-034: Tests must be independent and runnable in any order

### Future Extensibility

- REQ-TEST-040: Framework must support addition of coverage reporting
- REQ-TEST-041: Framework must support addition of performance benchmarks
- REQ-TEST-042: Framework must support parameterized/data-driven tests
- REQ-TEST-043: Framework must support fixtures for common test setup
- REQ-TEST-044: Framework must support CI/CD integration

### MSL-Specific Testing

- REQ-TEST-050: Parser tests must verify all MSL syntax features
- REQ-TEST-051: Validator tests must check all validation rules
- REQ-TEST-052: Tests must verify backward compatibility with older MSL levels
- REQ-TEST-053: Tests must include real-world MSL document examples
- REQ-TEST-054: Tests must verify error handling and edge cases

## Implementation Notes

### Minimal Initial Setup
- Install pytest via pip
- Basic pytest.ini configuration
- Simple test runner script
- Pre-commit hook integration

### No Over-Engineering
- No complex test frameworks
- No mandatory coverage thresholds (yet)
- No slow integration tests
- Keep it simple and fast

## Success Criteria

The testing framework is successful when:
1. New features don't break existing functionality
2. Tests run automatically before commits
3. Test failures are clear and actionable
4. Adding new tests is straightforward
5. Test suite remains fast and reliable
