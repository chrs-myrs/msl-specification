# Testing Framework Metaspecification [MSL]

## Overview

This metaspecification defines the structure and requirements that ALL testing framework specifications must follow. Any specification for a testing system should conform to this metaspec.

## Purpose

Testing frameworks are critical infrastructure that ensure software quality. This metaspec ensures that all testing framework specifications address the essential aspects of testing, regardless of the specific implementation technology.

## Requirements

### Structural Requirements

- REQ-META-001: Testing framework specifications MUST define the core testing infrastructure
- REQ-META-002: Testing framework specifications MUST specify test organization patterns
- REQ-META-003: Testing framework specifications MUST address regression prevention
- REQ-META-004: Testing framework specifications MUST define quality standards
- REQ-META-005: Testing framework specifications MUST consider extensibility

### Core Infrastructure Section

- REQ-META-010: Specifications MUST define the test runner technology or approach
- REQ-META-011: Specifications MUST specify test discovery mechanisms
- REQ-META-012: Specifications MUST define test file naming conventions
- REQ-META-013: Specifications MUST specify test function/method patterns
- REQ-META-014: Specifications MUST address test execution modes (individual vs suite)

### Test Organization Section

- REQ-META-020: Specifications MUST define directory structure for tests
- REQ-META-021: Specifications MUST distinguish unit vs integration tests
- REQ-META-022: Specifications MUST require tests for new features
- REQ-META-023: Specifications MUST define test-to-code mapping strategy
- REQ-META-024: Specifications MUST address test categorization or tagging

### Regression Prevention Section

- REQ-META-030: Specifications MUST define automated test execution triggers
- REQ-META-031: Specifications MUST specify failure handling procedures
- REQ-META-032: Specifications MUST require clear error reporting
- REQ-META-033: Specifications MUST address continuous testing strategy
- REQ-META-034: Specifications MUST define performance requirements for test suite

### Quality Standards Section

- REQ-META-040: Specifications MUST require deterministic test behavior
- REQ-META-041: Specifications MUST address test isolation and independence
- REQ-META-042: Specifications MUST define cleanup and teardown requirements
- REQ-META-043: Specifications MUST specify naming standards for clarity
- REQ-META-044: Specifications MUST address test documentation requirements

### Extensibility Section

- REQ-META-050: Specifications MUST consider future coverage reporting needs
- REQ-META-051: Specifications MUST address performance testing extensibility
- REQ-META-052: Specifications MUST plan for parameterized/data-driven tests
- REQ-META-053: Specifications MUST define fixture/setup sharing mechanisms
- REQ-META-054: Specifications MUST consider CI/CD integration points

### Domain-Specific Testing

- REQ-META-060: Specifications MUST address domain-specific testing needs
- REQ-META-061: Specifications MUST define validation for domain artifacts
- REQ-META-062: Specifications MUST specify backward compatibility testing
- REQ-META-063: Specifications MUST address integration testing requirements
- REQ-META-064: Specifications MUST define success criteria metrics

## Implementation Guidelines

### Required Sections

Testing framework specifications conforming to this metaspec MUST include:

1. **Overview** - Purpose and scope of the testing framework
2. **Core Infrastructure** - Test runner, discovery, execution
3. **Test Organization** - Structure, categories, mapping
4. **Regression Prevention** - Automation, CI/CD, gates
5. **Quality Standards** - Determinism, isolation, clarity
6. **Extensibility** - Future growth paths
7. **Domain-Specific** - Unique testing needs of the domain
8. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes

### Requirement Numbering

- Use REQ-TEST-XXX for general testing requirements
- Use REQ-UNIT-XXX for unit testing specific requirements
- Use REQ-INT-XXX for integration testing requirements
- Use REQ-PERF-XXX for performance testing requirements
- Use REQ-DOM-XXX for domain-specific requirements

### Compliance Levels

Testing framework specifications may declare compliance levels:

- **Minimal**: Meets REQ-META-001 through REQ-META-034
- **Standard**: Meets REQ-META-001 through REQ-META-054
- **Complete**: Meets all metaspec requirements

## Examples

# My Testing Framework Specification [MSL]

## Overview
[Purpose and scope]

## Requirements

### Core Infrastructure
- REQ-TEST-001: [Infrastructure requirement]
...

### Test Organization
- REQ-TEST-010: [Organization requirement]
...
```

## Validation

To validate a testing framework specification against this metaspec:

1. Check all required sections are present
2. Verify requirement coverage for each section
3. Confirm compliance level is accurately declared
4. Validate requirement ID formatting
5. Ensure domain-specific needs are addressed

## Success Criteria

A testing framework specification successfully implements this metaspec when:

1. All structural requirements (REQ-META-001 to REQ-META-005) are addressed
2. Each required section contains relevant requirements
3. The specification is internally consistent
4. Domain-specific testing needs are identified and addressed
5. Success criteria are measurable and achievable

## Notes

- This metaspec is technology-agnostic (applies to pytest, jest, junit, etc.)
- Specific implementations may add additional requirements beyond this metaspec
- The metaspec focuses on WHAT must be specified, not HOW to implement it
