## Requirements

### Test Execution

- REQ-RUNNER-001: Script must check for pytest installation before attempting to run tests
- REQ-RUNNER-002: Script must provide clear error message if pytest is not installed
- REQ-RUNNER-003: Script must run all tests in the tests/ directory by default

- REQ-RUNNER-013: Script must summarize results with clear pass/fail indication

### Exit Codes

- REQ-RUNNER-020: Script must exit with code 0 when all tests pass
- REQ-RUNNER-021: Script must exit with non-zero code when any tests fail
- REQ-RUNNER-022: Script must preserve pytest's exit code for CI/CD integration

### User Feedback

- REQ-RUNNER-030: Script must use visual indicators (✅/❌) for quick status recognition
- REQ-RUNNER-031: Script must suggest next steps when tests fail
- REQ-RUNNER-032: Script must be executable with standard shell permissions

## Non-Requirements
