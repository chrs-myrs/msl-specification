# MSL Tutorials

**Learn MSL through hands-on, practical tutorials. Each tutorial takes â‰¤30 minutes and teaches real-world specification patterns for AI-powered development.**

## Tutorial Path

### ðŸŽ¯ Beginner (Start Here)
1. [**Your First MSL Specification**](first-spec.md) - Create an AI-ready specification from scratch
2. [**Adding Validation**](validation.md) - Ensure quality with automated checks
3. [**AI Implementation Workflow**](ai-implementation.md) - Turn specs into code with AI

### ðŸš€ Intermediate
4. [**Using Inheritance**](inheritance.md) - Build specification families efficiently
5. [**Creating Templates**](templates.md) - Reusable patterns for consistency
6. [**Team Collaboration**](team-specs.md) - Coordinate human and AI developers

### ðŸ’ª Advanced
7. [**Building Specification Sets**](spec-sets.md) - Architect large systems
8. [**CI/CD Integration**](cicd.md) - Automate validation pipelines
9. [**Custom Validation Rules**](custom-validation.md) - Domain-specific quality gates

## Learning Objectives

After completing these tutorials, you will be able to:

âœ… **Write** AI-readable specifications that generate precise implementations  
âœ… **Validate** specifications to catch issues before AI implementation  
âœ… **Organize** large specification sets with inheritance and templates  
âœ… **Collaborate** effectively with teams using multiple AI assistants  
âœ… **Automate** specification quality in CI/CD pipelines  

## Prerequisites

- Text editor (VS Code, Vim, or any editor)
- Basic markdown knowledge
- (Optional) Node.js for validation tools
- (Optional) Access to AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

## Tutorial Format

Each tutorial follows this structure:

```markdown
