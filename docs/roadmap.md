# MSL Roadmap

**Building the foundation for AI-powered software development**

## Vision (2024-2026)

MSL will become the industry standard for human-AI collaboration in software development, enabling developers to work at the speed of thought while maintaining quality and control.

### Strategic Goals
1. **Universal AI Compatibility** - Every major AI assistant understands MSL natively
2. **Zero Friction Adoption** - Start with markdown, scale to enterprise
3. **Ecosystem Growth** - Rich tooling, integrations, and community
4. **Quality Assurance** - Catch AI hallucinations before production

## Release Schedule
