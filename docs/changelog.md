## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.1.x to 1.2.0

#### Breaking Change: Inheritance Markers

Old format (1.1.x):
```markdown
extends: parent-spec
## Requirements
- REQ-001: Modified requirement  # No marker needed
- REQ-010: New requirement       # No marker needed
```

New format (1.2.0):
```markdown
extends: parent-spec
## Requirements
- REQ-001: [OVERRIDE] Modified requirement  # Marker required
- REQ-010: [NEW] New requirement           # Marker required
```

**Migration Script:**
```bash
# Automatic migration available
npx msl-migrate inheritance-markers ./specs/
```

#### Deprecation: inherits â†’ extends

Old format:
```yaml
inherits: parent-spec
```

New format:
```yaml
extends: parent-spec
```

This will become an error in 2.0.0. Update now to avoid issues.

### Migrating from 1.0.x to 1.1.0

No breaking changes. New features are additive:
- Add frontmatter for metadata (optional)
- Add REQ-IDs for tracking (optional)
- Use inheritance for related specs (optional)
